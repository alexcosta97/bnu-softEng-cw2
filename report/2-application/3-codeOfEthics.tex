\chapter{Code Of Ethics}
FASAM intends to adhere fully to the ACM\/IEEE code of ethics.
In order to do that, we will make sure that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All team members know what the code of ethics are and adhere to item
    \item Penalize anyone that doesn't follow the code of ethics
\end{itemize}

FASAM is a safety-critical system, where people's lives can be at stake if the caution isn't taken and the code of ethics isn't followed at all times. We need to put the safety of people before anything else when building this type of system, even if that means taking longer to build the project or going over budget. It is in the best of the public interest that everyone affected by the system stays safe, and therefore that will be our first priority in regards to the development of the project, from requirements gathering to release to the public.
