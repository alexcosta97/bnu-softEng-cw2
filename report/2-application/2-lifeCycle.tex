\chapter{Life-cycle model}
We chose to use the waterfall life-cycle model for the FASAM project.

As seen in the theory part of this report, the waterfall cycle model is very suitable for large-scale, safety-critical system, which is exactly what the FASAM project is.

Because of the implications that the project could have in the safety of members of the public, it is imperative that all requirements and safety measures to be implemented in the system are fully understood before beginning the design and implementation of the system, which is why the waterfall model is the most suitable for this type of project.

That fact that everything needs to be documented was also another factor that inclined our choice, since we can more easily keep track of all the requirements and safety features to be implemented, therefore leaving no room for aspects to be left out of the system.
